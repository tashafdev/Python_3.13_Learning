🔰 Purpose:
This file explains how to use comments in Python.

👩‍💻 Created for personal Python 3.13 learning

🗒️ Python Comments Reference:
-------------------------------------
#                          → Single-line comment. Used to explain code or disable a line temporarily.
Triple quotes ('''...''' or \"\"\"...\"\"\")
                           → Multi-line strings. Often used as block comments or documentation (docstrings).
"""

# 👉 This is a single-line comment
# It helps explain what the code below is doing

# Below, we print a welcome message to the screen
print("Welcome to Python comments tutorial!")  # This is an inline comment

# You can also temporarily disable a line like this:
# print("This line is disabled and won’t run")

'''
This is a multi-line string using single quotes.
Even though Python doesn't treat this as a "true" comment,
it is often used to write large comment blocks.
'''

"""
You can also use triple double quotes like this
to write multi-line explanations or documentation.

# ✅ Tip:
# Only `#` is a real comment in Python (completely ignored by the interpreter)
# Triple quotes are still strings but often used like comments if unassigned
